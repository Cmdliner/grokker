This study investigates the modulatory effects of a polyherbal extract comprising Curculigo pilosa, Combretum micranthum, Spondias mombin, Piper guineense, Syzygium aromaticum, and Xylopia aethiopica on serum glutathione (GSH) levels in diethylstilbestrol (DES)-induced fibroid female Wistar rats. Thirty-two rats (150–200 g) were randomized into four groups of eight. Group 1 (control) received vehicle alone, while groups 2, 3, and 4 were administered DES at 1.5 mg, 2.0 mg, and 2.5 mg per body weight, respectively, in vehicle for 8 weeks to induce fibroids, confirmed by ultrasound scanning and histological examination. Acute toxicity testing of the polyherbal extract showed no mortality, confirming its safety. Post-induction, groups 2–4 received oral polyherbal extract at a uniform dose of 2.0 ml per body weight daily for 8 weeks in distilled water, while the control group received distilled water. Serum GSH levels were measured spectrophotometrically post-induction and post-treatment. Results indicated that DES induction significantly (p < 0.05) increased serum GSH levels (12.84 ± 0.32, 16.72 ± 0.41, 19.83 ± 0.53 mmol/L for 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 mg groups, respectively) compared to the control (11.96 ± 0.28 mmol/L). Post-treatment, the polyherbal extract significantly (p < 0.05) reduced serum GSH levels towards normal (11.2 ± 0.29, 10.8 ± 0.27, 11.5 ± 0.30 mmol/L for 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 mg groups, respectively), with the 2.0 mg DES group showing values closest to control. These findings suggest that the polyherbal extract mitigates oxidative stress in fibroid-induced rats by modulating serum GSH levels, supporting its potential as a complementary therapeutic agent for fibroid management.
